== Brief Description
   Interface for Mutexes on MS Windows.

== Prerequisites
   win32-ipc 0.5.0 or later

== Installation
=== Gem Installation
   gem install win32-mutex
=== Local Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install

== Synopsis
   require 'win32/mutex'

   # Do not leave out the 'Win32::', otherwise you're using Ruby's Mutex class.
   Win32::Mutex.new(false, 'test') do |m|
      # Do stuff
      m.release
   end

== Documentation
   The mutex.rb file contains inline RDoc documentation. If you installed
   this file as a gem, then you have the docs.

   For an example of win32-mutex in action, look at the example_win32_mutex.rb
   file in the 'examples' directory. You can also run the 'examples' rake task.

== Notes
   The Mutex class is a subclass of Win32::Ipc (win32-ipc). This library
   require's the win32-ipc library internally (you don't need to explicitly
   call it).

== Acknowledgements
   Originally adapted from the Win32::Mutex Perl module.

== Known Bugs  
   None that I know of. Please log any other bug reports on the RubyForge
   project page at http://www.rubyforge.net/projects/win32utils
